# Delphi Design Patterns

## What are Design Patterns?

Design patterns are reusable solutions to common software design problems. They represent best practices for solving specific issues in software development. By using design patterns, developers can create software that is more flexible, reusable, and easier to maintain.

## Installation

To use these design patterns in your Delphi project, simply download or clone this repository to your local machine.

```
git clone https://github.com/Pavel95/Delphi_Design_Patterns.git
```

## Usage

Each design pattern is located in its own folder and includes a Delphi project file (.dprj), source code (.pas), and any necessary files for the implementation. Simply open the project file in Delphi and run the program to see the design pattern in action.

Please note that the code style and language may not be consistent throughout the repository. Some pattern are represented by console application and other I written some comments in English and some in Czech language.
